# Bukowski Bot

This project was inspired by a blog post in /r/learnpython by user /u/benrules2 on how to create a simple markov chain. [That post can be found here.] (http://cyber-omelette.blogspot.com.au/2017/01/markov.html)

Using that idea of a markov chain, this project scrapes a bunch of poetry written by Charles Bukowski, and then feeds his poetry into the markov chain to create nonsensical tweets.

Here's the twitter bot in all its glory: <https://twitter.com/Bukowski_Blurb>

The website I scraped Bukowski's poetry from is <http://www.poemhunter.com/charles-bukowski/poems/>
